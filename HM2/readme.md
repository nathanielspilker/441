I believe I made a lot of rediscoveries this week. I have been practicing the main components of html and css as a refresher and also understood the basics of java script just fine. Luckily, I have taken creative coding in the past and remember working with basic java script in said class. I look forward to seeing how I can improve. I also had a much easier time with the assignment this week with working on console and simpler html.
