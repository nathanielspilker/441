I had a fun time with this weeks lesson. It proved its difficulties, but was fun. I have taken creative coding in the past and luckily I have finally gotten the hang of html and css again. The main difficulty for me was keeping track of which choice led to which. It was annoying. Another issue I ran into was getting my functions working, but the example was very helpful and the lesson on code academy also led me through the steps.
