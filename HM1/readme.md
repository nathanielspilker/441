This week was very challenging for me. I am ashamed to say I do not remember much of mart 341. This made this first assignment rather difficult to follow. For todays assignment, I followed along with the zip file provided and tried to recreate it to the best of my abilities. I remembered some techniques for making it work and not fall apart and what I needed to write text in. I could not find how to link my style sheet to my index however. I remember that you need to reference it with I believe and href, but I couldn't get it to work on my own. I am sad to say I have failed this assignment and am not sure if I should continue this course as it is. I hope I am able to understand more of the course ahead.
